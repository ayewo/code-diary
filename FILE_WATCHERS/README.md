# FILE WATCHERS

Outside of `lsof`, these are the following file system monitors/watchers that I am aware of:
* [`watchman`](https://github.com/facebook/watchman) -- [too enterprisey for my needs so I tried `fswatch`](https://github.com/ayewo/code-diary/blob/2aff5ee44386882584a9fa2887ef4eb27ef98782/Lima/PART_02.md#step-8-install-fswatch-as-watchman-from-facebook-is-too-enterprisey)
* [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) -- no opinion yet
* [`fsevent_watch`](https://github.com/proger/fsevent_watch) -- via [alin23](https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Making%20macOS%20apps%20uninstallable) [^1]
